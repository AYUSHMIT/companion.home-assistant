Welcome to the new Home Assistant Companion docs site! As we get closer to the utterly massive 2.0 release, we realized that we were quickly outgrowing our little piece of home-assistant.io and decided to set out on our own.

Currently, the existing docs for version 1.5 can be found here. Over time, 2.0 docs will be created.
